# Lab: Getting started with TailwindCSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework designed to enable users to create applications faster and easier. You can use utility classes to control the layout, color, spacing, typography, shadows, and more to create a completely custom component design — without leaving your HTML or writing a single line of custom CSS.

## Objectives

1. Initialize Tailwind inside Next.js
2. Style your blog
3. Make it responsive
4. Support dark mode

## Prerequisites

Continue with the existing code base from the completed previous lab. In case you didn't finish it, clone the [corrections repository](../../../../README.md#correction-repositories-and-supporting-source-code), checkout the corresponding `labX` tag and start from there. Later on, you must complete the missing lab by referring to the corrections.

## Part 1. Initialize Tailwind inside a Next.js application (easy level)

Follow the [official installation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs) guide to install Tailwind inside Next.js. Since you already have a Next.js application, start at step 2.

## Part 2. Prepare your code (easy level)

Removing all the imports in `/pages/**` and `components/**` to `/styles/*.module.css` as well as the references to `styles`.

Remove the `/styles/*.module.css` files (note, you might want to keep them as a reference for now and remove them later when you're done with the lab).

Make sure the `/styles/globals.css` only contains the `@tailwind` directives and nothing else.

## Part 3. Simple usage of Tailwind (medium level)

Use the [TailwindCSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com). The `ctrl-k` shortcut popup a convenient search box.

Open `/pages/articles.js`. Replace the code `<p style={{fontStyle: 'italic'}}>` with the equivalent TailwindCSS class. It should look like `<p className='{here is the name of the tailwind equivalent class}'>`. The text shall display in italic just like it used to be.

Now try to make both italic and bold.

## Part 3. Apply plugins (simple level)

Install the following Tailwind plugins inside the `tailwind.config.js` configuration file:

- tailwindcss-font-inter
- @tailwindcss/typography
- @tailwindcss/forms

Go back to your contact page, and the form input shall look a little better (a little better === still far from nice).

Don't forget to add the package dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn add`

## Part 4. Style the layout (hard level)

Replace all CSS modules declaration present inside `styles/Layout.module.css` and `styles/Contacts.module.css` with Tailwind classes. Start with the Header and Footer components and use the old `*.module.css` as a source of inspiration.

Don't hesitate to make it stylish.

## Part 5. Custom classes with the `@apply` directive (medium level)

To style the titles, we will create a `wt-title`. Note, "wt" stands for Web Tech.

Inside `styles/globals.css`, create the following class:

```css
.wt-title {
  @apply text-3xl font-bold underline mb-10;
}
```

In every occurence of "<h1>...</h1>" inside the `./pages` folder, add the `wt-title` class to the `className` attribute of each `h1` tag.
