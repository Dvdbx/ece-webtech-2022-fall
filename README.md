## Correction repositories and supporting source code

Each student group is associated (access is individually granted to [all students](https://github.com/adaltas/ece-webtech-2022-fall/discussions/1)) with a repository containing supporting source code for each lab work and its corrections:

- [Ing4 SI 01](https://github.com/adaltas/ece-webtech-2022-fall-gr01/)
- [Ing4 SI 02](https://github.com/adaltas/ece-webtech-2022-fall-gr02/)
- [Ing4 SI 03](https://github.com/adaltas/ece-webtech-2022-fall-gr03/)
- [Ing4 SI 04](https://github.com/adaltas/ece-webtech-2022-fall-gr04/)
- [Ing4 SI 05](https://github.com/adaltas/ece-webtech-2022-fall-gr05/)
- [Ing4 SI 06](https://github.com/adaltas/ece-webtech-2022-fall-gr06/)

The repositories use Git tags to make it easy to navigate:
- `labX` - contains prerequisites for the lab X.
- `labX-corrections` - contains corrections for the lab X.

They use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification with clean separation of code changes. Students are encouraged to carefully read and understand all commits.

## Using course materials
