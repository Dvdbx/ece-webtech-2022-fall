# Lab: deploy the application to production

## Part 1. Move your Supabase online

Supabase provides running [small databases](https://supabase.com/pricing) for free.

Signup and start a [Supabase project](app.supabase.com), then copy all your existing tables from the local Supabase instance.

Test the connection from your application by configuring the new values of the environment variables in `./app/.env`.

## Part 2. Deploy your Next.js application to Vercel

Signup on [Versel](https://vercel.com) with your GitHub account and create a new project by importing it from GitHub.
